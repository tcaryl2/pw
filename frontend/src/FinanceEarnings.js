                   The financial theory underlying asset pricing - including stock pricing - states that the fair price of an asset is determined as the sum of cash flows that asset will generate, discounted to present value. For publicly traded stocks these cash flows are the profits or losses of the company the stock represents. What this means is that according to standard financial theory stock prices should be correlated with the profit and loss information that is published in a company's earnings reports. Indeed, in 1971 Robert May noted that a previous researcher named Benston “hypothesized a relationship between the changes in stock prices and the measured rate of change in an accounting variable [in a quarterly earnings report]” and that two other researchers, Brown and Kennelly, had built models predicting stock movement on whether or not the accounting information was better or worse compared to market expectations (pp. 123-25).
